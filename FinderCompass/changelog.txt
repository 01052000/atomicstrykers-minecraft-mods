1.5.2B
Finder Compass now has a texture file for each resolution at /mods/findercompass/textures/items/compass*.png
With * being the texture size eg 16,32,64,128 and 256
This was necessary because Optifine does not allow different texture sizes to be loaded at the same time

updated to MC 1.5.1

1.5.1C
fixed display with Optifine using a custom Item Renderer

1.5.1B
fixed crash upon MP server connecting

1.5.1
updated to MC 1.5.1 and the new MC Texture System
Finder Compass now has a texture file at /mods/findercompass/textures/items/compass.png
If you have a texture pack and want high-res Finder compass, it needs to override that file!!!
Finder Compass now needs an Item ID (to setup a fake/real texture)
if you so desire, it can also be an actual craftable Item (see new FinderCompassItemConfig.cfg)
if the Item is enabled, the standard compass remains unchanged (server authority)
the Item recipe is a compass in middle, plus diamonds on all 4 sides
Finder Compass (Item or hack) uses an included 32x texture

1.4.6d
added possibility for servers to override the Finder Compass config of the connected clients
to override clients, simply install your config on the server like you would on client
