USAGE:
See config file for options. "Use Item" binding of Minecraft with compass in hand switches setting preset.


TO INSTALL:

- Requires FML (Forge ModLoader, it's also part of Forge!)
- Extract the /setup/ folder found in this archive into your .minecraft folder. The mod zip needs to end up in the .minecraft/mods/ folder and the .cfg file needs to be in .minecraft/config/


Scanrange default is 7 Block lengths, it can be set in the configuration file.

The Scanrange distinction is for people with shitty computers - it will re-scan once you move one block, and shitty computers might stop while they sift through the 3600 blocks within 15 blocks range.
7 range immediatly cuts this to 784 blocks.

Note the scan is height sensitive - your compass will not show diamond you wouldn't see if you dug a standard 2x1 tunnel to where the compass points you.
(because its 1 block further down or upward behind another block).

Default needles are Spawn Zone (red) and Stronghold Locator (dark greenish).



I've also added the possibility of making your own 'Needles'. Read findercompass.cfg which you put in your .minecraft folder for more info
