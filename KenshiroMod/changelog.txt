1.0.0
- initial re-code and port to FML and the 1.3.2 environment. Fully multiplayer capable.

- changed how the Kenshiro Combo works so it would work somewhat balanced against other players:
  Each hit punch now deals the equivalent to a diamond sword slash in damage. If an Entity/Player would die from another hit,
  your punches stop dealing damage, and the Entity is placed in the "you're fucked now" list. A short time after your Kenshiro
  Combo ended, all Entities on that list die a sudden and extremely satisfying death.
  
- instead of the first punch rooting a target immovably in a place, each strike cripples their movement speed
  further. Does not affect Players.
  
- two Players using Kenshiro Combo's on each other and not dodging hits would thus most likely both die in almost every case

- as before, the first Punch will stop Creepers from exploding and Skeleton Archers from shooting... ever again.

- changed Kick of Justice to also set the victim on fire.

- Kick will never really work on Players right because the Player movement is handled by the Players, not the Server
