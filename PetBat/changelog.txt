1.1.0
added Dynamic Lights integration module
if you have Dynamic Lights running, you can 'use' Glowstone dust
on your bat to make it shine light for a time. Light Effect does
not stay on the Bat when it turns into an Item for whatever reason,
or when you quit the game.
fixed UTF-8 encoding on GUI text .. again

1.0.9
changed Itemifying: If the Bat Item cannot be added to your inventory,
the bat drops as Item wherever it is at the moment. Teleporting into
your Inventory because of too great distance simply won't happen while
your inventory is full.
