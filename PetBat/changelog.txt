overriding Entity Names now to fix mods like damage indicator
may or may not break existing bat entities. turn them into items before upgrading!

rewrote Item-to-Bat transition, should work in more cases now
that means the "I was cheated" bat wipe should occur less

hurting yourself will no longer bring the bats onto you

added Dynamic Lights integration module
if you have Dynamic Lights running, you can 'use' Glowstone dust
on your bat to make it shine light for a time. Light Effect does
not stay on the Bat when it turns into an Item for whatever reason,
or when you quit the game.
fixed UTF-8 encoding on GUI text .. again

your Inventory because of too great distance simply won't happen while
your inventory is full.
