# BASICS
# This file is designed to be copied into the mods/resources/ruins folder and be
# edited to create a new template.  It is functional as-is; you can use it as
# a placeholder for future templates after renaming it.
#
# Templates have a .tml extension and the mod will attempt to load any and
# all files with that extension if it resides in the <minecraft root>/
# mods/resources/ruins folder.  Whether it does so successfully or not can be
# checked in the log file (<minecraft root>/ruins_log.txt).  The mod will also
# load any templates found in the biome folders within
# <minecraft root>/mods/resources/ruins.  A normal install should have 12 biome
# folders.
#
# These template files are a simple text file; simply open them in your
# favorite text editor to make changes or create new ones.
#
# There are three sections to each template file:
# VARIABLES define how the template is generated.
# BLOCK RULES define how the layers are generated.
# LAYERS tells the mod how to place blocks using BLOCK RULES.
#
# You can specify a comment by placing a "#" character at the beginning of the
# line.  You technically /don't/ have to do this, since the mod only looks for
# particular line starts when loading a template, but I consider it good form 
# because it increases readability and you prevent any errant line reads.


# VARIABLES
#
# biomesToSpawnIn=<name1>,<name2>,<name3>...
# Adds the Template being loaded (regardless which folder it is in) to a Ruins Biome
# found in the Minecraft Biomelist so that <namex> matches the Biome's name.
# If you don't know a Biome's name, find it's folder. The foldername equals the
# Biome name. Case insensitive. A Template cannot be added to a Biome more than once.
# The Template is still added to the corresponding folder it was loaded from (if not already in).
# example: biomesToSpawnIn=forest,foresthills,taiga
# Optional. You can use the folders as before, or use this to save space, or both.
#
# weight=<weight>
# Weight is how much weight this template has during random generation.  When
# the mod asks for a template to place it adds up the weights of all templates
# that are currently loaded and generates a random number based off of that
# total, then checks to see what template to load.  If the mod loads five
# templates with weights 1, 5, 5, 10 and 10, the template with weight 10 has a
# 10 in 31 chance of being generated, while the template with weight 1 has a 1
# in 31 chance of being generated.  A template only has weight in its biome.
# Defaults to 1.
#
# unique=<yes/no>
# If this is set to 1:
# If the template is generic, it can only ever be generated once per world.
# If the template is biome-specific, it can only ever be generated once in the
# biome per world (so you could duplicate it to other biome folders).
# Defaults to 0 (no).
#
# embed_into_distance=<number of layers>
# Specifies how many layers to embed into the target blocks.  This is useful
# for creating basements or dungeons.
# Defaults to 1.
#
# acceptable_target_blocks=<blockID>,<blockID>,<etc...>
# This is a comma-delimited list of block IDs that this template can spawn on.
# Only the top layer of blocks where the template will spawn are checked.
# Defaults to no acceptable blocks.
#
# dimensions=<height>,<width>,<length>
# Defines how big this template is.  Height is the number         n
# of layers that are used, not the height that sticks out         n
# above the ground.  Width is the north-south width, and       www*eee
# length is the east-west width.  For reference, north in         s
# the template is the top of the text file.                       s
# All default to 0.
#
# allowable_overhang=<overhang>
# Specifies the number of air blocks that can exist under this template when
# building begins.  Only the target blocks are checked.  Later world generation
# may change this so do not expect concrete results.
# Defaults to 0.
#
# max_cut_in=<cut in>
# Specifies the maximum height above the source block, within the build site,
# that can be removed in order to level the site.  All blocks that are higher
# than the source block will be removed.
# Defaults to 0.
#
# cut_in_buffer=<cbuffer>
# The distance around the build site that will also be leveled.  Values higher
# than 5 will use 5, since the world would otherwise be mangled pretty badly.
# Defaults to 0.
#
# max_leveling=<leveling>
# Specifies the maximum depth below the source block, within the build site,
# that will be filled with the source block in order to level the site.  All
# clear space underneath the site will be filled.  If this is set to anything
# greater than 0 allowable_overhang will be ignored.  Any filling will take
# place before the site is built, preserving basement space.
# Defaults to 0.
#
# leveling_buffer=<lbuffer>
# The distance around the build site that will also be filled.  Values higher
# than 5 will use 5, since the world would otherwise be mangled pretty badly.
# Defaults to 0.
#
# preserve_water=<yes/no>
# If set to 1 all site checking rules will treat water as air so that the ruin
# can be generated beneath/in water.  Any rules that replace a block with air
# will respect water and not replace it.  If set to 0, water is treated like 
# any other block.
# Defaults to 0/no.
#
# preserve_lava=<yes/no>
# If set to 1 all site checking rules will treat lava as air so that the ruin
# can be generated beneath/in lava.  Any rules that replace a block with air
# will respect lava and not replace it.  If set to 0, lava is treated like 
# any other block.
# Defaults to 0/no.
#
# preserve_plants=<yes/no>
# If set to 1 all site checking rules will treat trees, leaves, and cactus as
# air so that the ruin can be generated in and around them.  Any rules that
# replace a block with air will respect trees, leaves, and cactus and not
# replace them.  If set to 0, trees, leaves, and cactus are treated like 
# any other blocks.  Cactus adjacent to other blocks will break down, so you
# may not actually see cactus in your structure.
# Defaults to 0/no
#
# NOTE: When using preserve_water and preserve_lava it is advised that you
# restrict the cut_in_buffer as much as possible, preferably to 0.  If it is
# more than 0 you may get some unexpected fluid dynamics if the structure
# does not spawn completely in water/lava.

# BLOCK RULES
# Each rule must be formatted carefully:
# rule<number>=<condition>,<chance to appear>,<list of blocks>
#
# rule<number>
# The mod does not care what you call these and will number the rules in the
# order they are loaded (sequentially from 1), so long as the line start with
# "rule".  I suggest using "rule#" as a mnemonic, such as "rule1", "rule2",
# "rule12", etc...  Once the templates are loaded, the first rule in the list
# becomes rule #1 for the purposes of building a layer, the second becomes rule
# #2, and so on.
#
# The mod uses a special rule, 0, which defines the Air block with a 100% spawn
# rate and no conditional.  You can use this rule in the layers to "blank out"
# certain areas (providing space for mobs, for instance).
#
# <condition>
# A conditional to the block being placed, aside from randomness.
# 0 - The block always attempts to spawn.
# 1 - There must be a block below it to attempt to spawn.
# 2 - There must be an adjacent block at the same level for a spawn attempt.
# 3 - There must be a block above this one in order for it to attempt to spawn.
#
# Adjacent in this case is not diagonal, only along the cardinal directions.
#
# Adjacent blocks are processed after 0 and 1 conditionals have been placed,
# and "under blocks" are processed after all other blocks have been placed.
# Please note that these blocks are still processed in an order dependent on
# the rotation of the site.  For a normal, north-facing site, the block rules
# are processed for each line from the left and from the bottom template to the
# top.
#
# <chance to appear>
# The chance that this block will appear, out of 100, depending on whether the
# condition above is met.
#
# <list of blocks>
# A comma-delimited set of minecraft blockIDs.  This will determine what block
# will actually spawn in the location.  Each blockID is given the same weight,
# so you can skew the odds of a certain blockID appearing by adding it multiple
# times.  You can specify block metadata by adding a "-<metadata>" after the
# blockID.  For instance, to place a cobblestone stairs block ascending to the
# east, use 67-3.  To place a wood half-block (slab), use 44-2.
#
# You can find a list of blockIDs and commonly-used metadata at the Minepedia
# website (Google it).

#
# As of 8.6, you can also specify a Block Name instead of it's numeric ID! This should be
# very useful to use Ruins with other Mods and changible Block IDs. Make sure to use the
# absolute Blockname, not the translation! Example: "44-2" can also be written as "stoneSlab-2"
#
#
# Example 1: rule1=0,100,0,4,48
# This spawns either air, cobblestone, or a mossy cobblestone 100% of the time.
#
# Example 2: rule1=1,50,48
# This spawns a mossy cobblestone 50% of the time but only if another block
# is underneath it.
#
# Example 3: rule1=2,100,44-2,5
# This spawns either a wood slab or a plank block, but only if there is an
# adjacent block on the same level.
#
# Example 4: rule1=0,100,50-5
# This spawns a torch standing on the ground.
#
# Example 5: rule1=0,25,MediumChest
# This spawns a Medium Chest (see above) 25% of the time.
#
# Example 6: rule1=0,50,MobSpawner:Villager
# This spawns a Mob Spawner with Mob Id "Villager" 50% of the time
#
#
# Ruins 9.0 exposes minecraft ChestGenHook for your meddling. Usage:
#
# Example 7: rule1=0,100,ChestGenHook:dungeonChest:10
# This spawns a chest and tells the Minecraft generator to fill it with "10" items of the "dungeonChest" preset.
# This might include extremely powerful items added by mods.
#
#	here is the complete list (as of mc 1.4.7) of ChestGen presets:
#   "mineshaftCorridor"; "pyramidDesertyChest"; "pyramidJungleChest"; "pyramidJungleDispenser"; "strongholdCorridor";
#   "strongholdLibrary"; "strongholdCrossing"; "villageBlacksmith"; "bonusChest"; "dungeonChest";
#
#	As of 10.6, all chest rules can also append a metadata/rotation int similar to a chest block ID
#	example: rule1=0,100,ChestGenHook:dungeonChest:10-5
#	for a chest filled with dungeon loot and rotated to meta 5.
#
#
# Ruins 10.3 adds Command Block Support. Usage:
# Example 8: rule1=0,100,CommandBlock:command:sender
# command being the Command string to be executed and sender being the Command sender (a player name, Rcon...)


rule1=0,100,0,43,44
rule2=0,100,4,48
rule3=1,50,45


# LAYERS
# Each layer is a comma-delimited list of rules, one for each block.  There
# must be as many layers as the height, and each layer must have "layer" before
# the rules and end with "endlayer".  There are as many rows as the length, and
# as many rules as the width.  If you want the block blanked out use 0, which
# represents the Air-block rule.
