8.6

+ relevant part of template_rules.txt:

#        /*
#         * Conversion table from old Ruins 8.5 template style to new 8.6+ style
#         * 
#         * Just handling the part where you used to specify 'special' blocks
#         * Full Example: "rule1=0,25,310" turns into "rule1=0,25,MediumChest"
#         * 
#         * 300 -> preserveBlock
#         * 301 -> MobSpawner:Zombie
#         * 302 -> MobSpawner:Skeleton
#         * 303 -> MobSpawner:Spider
#         * 304 -> MobSpawner:Creeper
#         * 305 -> UprightMobSpawn
#         * 306 -> EasyMobSpawn
#         * 307 -> MediumMobSpawn
#         * 308 -> HardMobSpawn
#         * 309 -> EasyChest
#         * 310 -> MediumChest
#         * 311 -> HardChest
#         * 315-0'Villager -> MobSpawner:Villager
#         * 
#         */
# As of 8.6, you can also specify a Block Name instead of it's numeric ID! This should be
# very useful to use Ruins with other Mods and changible Block IDs. Make sure to use the
# absolute Blockname, not the translation! Example: "44-2" can also be written as "stoneSlab-2"

8.7
+ update to MC 1.4.6

8.8
+ synchronized World Generation Hook, also made sure the 0,0 chunk doesn't ever spawn anything

  for your Ruins, if you make rotation mappings for them.
+ read /mods/resources/ruins/rotation_mappings.txt for information and examples
+ to facilitate the figuring out of block names and metadata, Ruins will now print out the
  relevant information about a block ingame if you tap it with a "stick".

9.6
+ added generation for the End (Biome "sky")
