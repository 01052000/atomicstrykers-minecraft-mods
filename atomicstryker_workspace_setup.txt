Folder structure this file resides in

./
	./../forgegradle	-> contains gradlew.bat along with the new forge setup
	./**/        		-> contains the Eclipse Workspace with projects in it. Each project has an ant build file

To setup my workspace in your eclipse, simply setup Forge, then move your eclipse workspace into this folder.


Each project/mod contains a Gradle build file which creates download files in their respective /build/libs (or /build/distributions) folders.
Gradle is required, however one could also use the gradlew wrapper found in forgegradle to do this.

THIS ASSUMES YOUR MOD COMPILES AGAINST FORGEGRADLE - if there are compile errors in the eclipse project, it will fail.


NOTE: Some projects attempt to include the Update Checker into their packages, which means it should be built first.


Stuff that needs changing each version:

- in "./properties" you find the minecraft version that is appended by the scripts to all resulting mod- and archivenames.
- change is according to minecraft version only, so that you can keep overwriting your Dropbox/whatever link for the current MC version

- each mod has a changelog, add new version
- each mod has a mcmod.info, change to new versions (mod and mc both)
- each mod has a @Mod sourcefile, generally in the common side, in which you need to change the "version =" property


Mods with special Needs:

-- Multi Mine
- Multi Mine needs it's dummy jar (containing only the Manifest.MF) in /mcp/jars/mods/ if you want it to work through MCP
- Multi Mine uses hardcoded obfuscated names in it's sourcefile "common\atomicstryker\multimine\common\fmlmagic\MMTransformer.java"
- those need to be fixed each time minecraft obfuscation changes.
- a good place to get working obfuscated names from is /mcp/conf/: joined.srg, methods.csv and fields.csv
- another good place is MCPBot in the MCP IRC channels, assuming it runs the version you need

-- Dynamic Lights
- similar to Multi Mine. sourcefile is "common\atomicstryker\dynamiclights\common\DLTransformer.java"

-- Stalker Creepers
- similar to Multi Mine. sourcefile is "common\atomicstryker\stalkercreepers\common\SCTransformer.java"

-- Kenshiro Mod
- uses some hacky stuff for rendering and manipulating punched entities. Will probably crash if broken.

-- Advanced Machines and Ropes+
- rely on external packages, namely IC2 and NEI
