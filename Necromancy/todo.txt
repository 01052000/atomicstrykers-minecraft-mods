Rituals are done with your Necronomicon and a variety of scent burners. Have several burners in an enclosed space and light a mixture of dyes up.
Each dye has his own properties. By burning several of them, the properties get combined forming an aura that can be used to summon higher powers.

The dye properties and colors goes as following:
 Red: Courage, health and lust
 Magenta: Progress
 Pink: Friendship and love
 Orange: Attraction, encouragement
 Yellow: Persuasion and protection
 Lime: Peace and joy
 Green: Abundance, fertility
 Cyan: Selfishness
 Light Blue: Knowledge
 Blue: Depression and vulnerability
 Purple: Ambition and power
 Brown: Earth, buried
 Black: Negativity, banishment and death
 White: Purity and truth
 Gray: Instability and chaos
 Light gray: Unorthodox

When you have the right aura for the ritual you wish to perform, a sacrifice is required. This is done on the sacrifical altar. The required sacrifices are different for each spell.
Damaging spells require death. It's pain will be passed on to your enemies.
Buffing spells require blood. Blood is the source of life.
De-buffing spells require souls. Multiple souls in one body cause instability.
The more you sacrifice, the stronger the spell gets.

When the ritual is complete, a page will be added to the necronomicon. When you open the necronomicon and select the spell, it can be cast by pressing the according hotkey.
