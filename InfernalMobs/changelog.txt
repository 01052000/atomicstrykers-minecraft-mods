1.1.9
- added possibility for Blocks and metadata/damage in dropped loot
- old config syntax remains valid, to add Item "500" with meta/damage "3" add "500-3" to config
- Blocks are added similar, "blockID-metaValue-stackSize", example "35-4-10" is 10 Blocks of yellow Wool (id 35, meta 4)
- meta and stacksize need not be specified and default to 0 and 1
- instead of a numeric ID you may also use the code name, example "tile.cloth-4-10" is the same Wool as above
- this may help with mod items or blocks whose IDs are subject to change
- only Items can and will be randomly enchanted
- automatically detects and randomly enchants Enchanted Books. Added those to default ID list (403)
